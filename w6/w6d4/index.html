    <h1 style='color: blue'>The Planning Season</h1>

    <p>Before the annual calendar switches over and we officially ring in the new year,
       I find myself perusing the races on UltraSignup.
       I clear the filters and look at the expansive inventory of possibilities
       while dreaming of the epic adventures that potentially await.
       I click on races that seem to excite me for one reason or another, delving into the details.
       I trend toward events that both terrify and motivate me.
      An odd combination of feelings to describe to an outsider,
      but for me if there isnâ€™t intrigue and a bit of fear, why do it?
    </p>

    <p>I find myself giddy, but notice that I am white knuckling the
      computer mouse as I examine race dates, distances, elevation gain/loss,
      the level of competition, and more. After picking one or two goal races, I then seek
      training races to help support these exhilarating aspirations. Once I feel
      like I have what could be the scaffolding for my season, I look into the process
      of gaining entry into each of the races. With lotteries, race caps, deadlines,
      and qualifying components, it seems that the planning every year
      needs to start earlier and earlier.
